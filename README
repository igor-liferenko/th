TODO: get rid of th-cmd and its dependencies (obey.c, cmdsocket.c, et al.)

Start (specify --daemon to background it, but without it you will see helpful messages
       (FIXME: see how it is determined that we are not a daemon - maybe use the same method
       in tel.w)):

	thd --triggers /etc/triggerhappy/triggers.d/ /dev/input/event*

Dump all events:

	thd --dump /dev/input/event*

Devices can be added dynamically by specifying a command socket:

	thd --socket /var/run/triggerhappy.socket --triggers /etc/triggerhappy.d/
