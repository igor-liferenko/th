NOTE: this repo is a supplement to QUIRE.tex from mytex repo

In each document using QUIRE.tex add this after setting \hsize:
    \advance\hsize by-\QUIRE
and this to output routine:
    \ifodd\pageno\else\hoffset=\QUIRE\fi

Until document is completed, use '\qtwopages \shipout\vbox{}' instead of '\quire{...}'
After printing:
1. bend each sheet in the middle
2. connect the sheets with staples
3. mark protruding part of upper sheet with sharp pencil and cut along the mark
4. repeat step 3 for each sheet until reaching half of sheets
5. overturn the document and go to step 3
