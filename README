Examples:

Dump all events received through two device files:

	thd --dump /dev/input/event0 /dev/input/event1

Devices can be added dynamically by specifying a command socket:

	thd --socket /var/run/triggerhappy.socket --triggers /etc/triggerhappy.d/

The program th-cmd is used to add new devices to the daemon:

	th-cmd /var/run/triggerhappy.socket add /dev/input/event0
	th-cmd /var/run/triggerhappy.socket remove /dev/input/event3

For more information, consult the manual pages of "thd" and "th-cmd".

Use th-cmd commands from the following files, if necessary:

	init_d-triggerhappy
	hotplug-triggerhappy
